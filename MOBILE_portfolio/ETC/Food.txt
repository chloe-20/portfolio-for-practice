INGREDIENTS

1 cup (175 g) dates (if dry, soak in warm water until softened, drain)
1/2 cup (120 mL) tahini
3 cups (270 g) old-fashioned rolled oats (gluten-free if desired)
1 cup (140 g) raw mixed nuts (almond and cashew work well), roughly chopped
1/2 cup (75 g) raisins
1/4 cup (30 g) dried cranberries
1/4 cup (35 g) raw sunflower seeds
1/4 cup (35 g) raw pumpkin seeds
1/4 cup (15 g) unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon


DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 150 C / 300 F.
Mix dates, tahini and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) water in a food processor and blend until creamy.
And all ingredients to a large bowl and mix to combine.
Spread the granola evenly on baking paper and press flat. Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, stopping one or two times to stir and flatten again if needed to prevent burning and to ensure the granola cooks evenly.
Let cool and transfer to an airtight container to store. Enjoy with plant-based milk, smoothies, plant-based yogurts or on its own as a snack.


TIPS

Switch up the varieties of raw nuts, raw seeds, and dried fruit for a different variation.
Store in an air-tight container on the counter for up to two weeks.

Step 2: Choose 1-2 cup of fresh or frozen vegetables you have on hand, diced, shredded, or cubed. Some great options are: frozen peas, corn, diced carrots, celery, zucchini, peppers, broccoli florets, etc.

In mixing bowl, moisten the day-old rice with a few tablespoons of water. This will help separate the grains so the rice is easier to handle while cooking. Set aside.
In a large frying pan or wok, heat the vegetable or peanut oil over high heat. Add diced onion for a few minutes until translucent then add in garlic 30 seconds after. Be constantly moving the onions to avoid burning.
Once fragrant, add vegetables and protein of choice along with the rice. Mix completely.

TIPS

Try fresh chilies to make this dish even more fiery - add them sliced while sautéing the onions. Finish with an additional drizzle of toasted sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of vegan butter, toss and serve.
To increase the protein punch, cut back the rice by 1/2 a cup and add in an additional cup of your protein of your choice from step 1. Add in hemp seeds, raw cashews, walnuts or almonds while sautéing the onions, or/and finish your Fried Rice with toasted seeds. You can also pair your Fried Rice with any prepared plant-based protein such as Baked Tofu (see recipe) or Tempeh Bacon (see recipe) or other plant-based meats if you have not already added them.
